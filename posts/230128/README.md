# text mode login


When you press the power button on your computer, software of the computer shows black screen which needs your username and password 
to log in the system.

Let's assume that your computer doesn't have graphical user interface to login you will see the black screen which is called text mode login.

The /sbin/init program coordinates the rest of the boot process and configures the environment for the user.

When the init command starts, it becomes the parent or grandparent of all of the processes that start up automatically on system.

In this step we see username and password panel.

Let's log in :)
